# Python_Project
The primary aim of this study is to develop a reliable predictive model for stroke detection by analysing a comprehensive healthcare dataset. Through Python-based data analysis, the study
seeks to identify key factors that contribute to stroke risk and evaluate the accuracy of machine learning models in predicting stroke. The ultimate goal is to provide insights that can improve
early detection, enhance prevention strategies, and assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals.

➢ Predict Stroke Occurrence: The objective is to accurately predict whether a patient is likely
to experience a stroke based on their medical history, demographics, and lifestyle factors. The
goal is to identify the most significant features that contribute to stroke risk.

➢ Visualize Patient Data with Graphs: Generate insightful visualizations, such as histograms,
box plots, and scatter plots, to understand the distribution and relationships between factors
like age, glucose levels, hypertension, and stroke occurrence. These plots will help reveal
trends and anomalies in the data.

➢ Optimize Machine Learning Models: Apply different machine learning models (e.g., logistic
regression, decision trees, random forest) to predict stroke occurrence and tune
hyperparameters for the best-fitting model, ensuring maximum accuracy in the predictions.
